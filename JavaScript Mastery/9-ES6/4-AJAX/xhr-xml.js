//AJAX = Asynchronous JavasScript and XML

/*It is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the 
"client side" to create asynchronous web applications.

With AJAX web apps can send and retreive data from a server asynchronously 
(in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the 
existing page

We don't use data in XML format anymore, we use JSON now.

We have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server

1. XML HTTPRequest (Old way of doing)
2. Fetch API (New way of doing)
3. Axios (Third party library)
